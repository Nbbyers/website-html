        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I am a senior at BYU and will be graduating this April with my
          bachelor's degree in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've taken on a few personal projects to help expand my knowledge. Most
          notable have been an app to help track dirt bike rides and maintenaince,
          as well as an app to help arrange for better carpooling to and from the Utah
          ski canyons.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          Ski canyons are struggling with a huge influx of congestion. Resorts are 
          capitalizing on this by charging for parking. UDOT is working out the 
          details for a $500M gondola. Neither of these "fixes" help the skiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitch-a-Ride is an app designed to help people link up with other users 
          along their route to and from the mountain. This helps everybody save money 
          on gas and parking, all while taking cars out of the canyon.
